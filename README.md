* Dependency Injection
 - Dependencies are services or objects that a class needs to perform its function. Dependency injection, or DI, 
 - Is a design pattern in which a class requests dependencies from external sources rather than creating them. Use Angular DI to increase flexibility and modularity in your applications. 
 - The @Injectable() decorator specifies that Angular can use this class in the DI system
 
 * ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation
  - (AOT) compiler converts Angular HTML and TypeScript code into efficient JavaScript code during the build phase, before the browser downloads and runs that code
  - less load time and better peroformance than JIT
  - This is the best compilation mode for Production Environments,
